## Predicting 2024 Indian Elections: A Sentiment Analysis Approach Using Twitter Data

Twitter has emerged as a powerful tool for political discourse and sentiment analysis. 
This project aims to leverage the vast repository of tweets to predict the outcomes of the Indian elections in 2024. By analyzing the sentiments expressed in these tweets, we seek to uncover patterns and trends that may influence the electoral process. 
Through this analysis, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the factors that shape election outcomes, offering valuable insights for political strategists, researchers, and policymakers.

## Requirements
### Software Requirements:
Operating System: WINDOWS OR LINUX.
Network Traffic Capture Tools: Software tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic data.
Machine Learning Libraries: Python libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for implementing supervised learning algorithms.
Data Processing Tools: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Such as Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm for coding and experimentation.
